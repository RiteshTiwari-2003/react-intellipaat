React Life cycle ;

Life Cycle of component :
each component in react has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases:
the three phases are : mounting , updating and unmounting 

1. Mounting ;
mounting means putting elements into dom 
React has four buildin method that gets called int the order when mounting a component :
1. constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromprops()
3. render()
4. componentdidmount()

the render () method is required and will always be called , the other are optional and will be caled if you define them .

constructor()
constructor is called before anything else when teh component is initiated , and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other the initial values 
the constructor method is called with the props as a argument 

getderivedstatefromprops()
this method is called right before rendering the element int he dom 
this is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props 
it takes state as argument and return an object with changes in state 

class Header extends React.Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state={
            favoirateColor:"red"
        };
    }
    static getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state){
        return {favoirateColor:props.favcol};
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <h1>My favoirate color is {this.state.favoirateColor} </h1>
        )
    }
}
const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementbyId("root"));
root.render(<Header favcol="yellow"/>)


3. render() method is always called , this method is required and is the method that actually output the html to the dom 

4. the componentdidmount(); this method is called after render method , this is where you run statement that require that the component is already placed in dom 

the next phase is updating when the component is updating in this phase these built in function come like 
1. getDerivedStateFromprops()
2. shouldcomponentupdate()
3. render()
4. getSanpShotBeforeupdate()
5. componentdidupdate()

the render ethod is required and always be called the other are o[tional] 

3. phase 
unmounting 
the next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the dom 
react has only one built in function for unmounting phase which is componentwillunmount()
